# Omnipowers Release Notes

> **Fork Note**: Omnipowers was forked from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) at v4.1.1 (2026-01-23).

Historical changes prior to the fork are documented in the [original superpowers repository](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/main/RELEASE-NOTES.md).

## v5.0.6 (2026-03-24)

### Inline Self-Review Replaces Subagent Review Loops

The subagent review loop (dispatching a fresh agent to review plans/specs) doubled execution time (~25 min overhead) without measurably improving plan quality. Regression testing across 5 versions with 5 trials each showed identical quality scores regardless of whether the review loop ran.

- **brainstorming** — replaced Spec Review Loop (subagent dispatch + 3-iteration cap) with inline Spec Self-Review checklist: placeholder scan, internal consistency, scope check, ambiguity check
- **writing-plans** — replaced Plan Review Loop (subagent dispatch + 3-iteration cap) with inline Self-Review checklist: spec coverage, placeholder scan, type consistency
- **writing-plans** — added explicit "No Placeholders" section defining plan failures (TBD, vague descriptions, undefined references, "similar to Task N")
- Self-review catches 3-5 real bugs per run in ~30s instead of ~25 min, with comparable defect rates to the subagent approach

### Brainstorm Server

- **Session directory restructured** — the brainstorm server session directory now contains two peer subdirectories: `content/` (HTML files served to the browser) and `state/` (events, server-info, pid, log). Previously, server state and user interaction data were stored alongside served content, making them accessible over HTTP. The `screen_dir` and `state_dir` paths are both included in the server-started JSON. (Reported by 吉田仁)

### Bug Fixes

- **Owner-PID lifecycle fixes** — the brainstorm server's owner-PID monitoring had two bugs causing false shutdowns within 60 seconds: (1) EPERM from cross-user PIDs (Tailscale SSH, etc.) was treated as "process dead", and (2) on WSL the grandparent PID resolves to a short-lived subprocess that exits before the first lifecycle check. Fixed by treating EPERM as "alive" and validating the owner PID at startup — if it's already dead, monitoring is disabled and the server relies on the 30-minute idle timeout. This also removes the Windows/MSYS2-specific carve-out from `start-server.sh` since the server now handles it generically. (#879)
- **writing-skills** — corrected false claim that SKILL.md frontmatter supports "only two fields"; now says "two required fields" and links to the agentskills.io specification for all supported fields (PR #882 by @arittr)

### Codex App Compatibility

- **codex-tools** — added named agent dispatch mapping documenting how to translate Claude Code's named agent types to Codex's `spawn_agent` with worker roles (PR #647 by @arittr)
- **codex-tools** — added environment detection and Codex App finishing sections for worktree-aware skills (by @arittr)
- **Design spec** — added Codex App compatibility design spec (PRI-823) covering read-only environment detection, worktree-safe skill behavior, and sandbox fallback patterns (by @arittr)

## v5.0.5 (2026-03-17)

### Bug Fixes

- **Brainstorm server ESM fix** — renamed `server.js` → `server.cjs` so the brainstorming server starts correctly on Node.js 22+ where the root `package.json` `"type": "module"` caused `require()` to fail. (PR #784 by @sarbojitrana, fixes #774, #780, #783)
- **Brainstorm owner-PID on Windows** — skip PID lifecycle monitoring on Windows/MSYS2 where the PID namespace is invisible to Node.js, preventing the server from self-terminating after 60 seconds. (#770, docs from PR #768 by @lucasyhzlu-debug)
- **stop-server.sh reliability** — verify the server process actually died before reporting success. SIGTERM + 2s wait + SIGKILL fallback. (#723)

### Changed

- **Execution handoff** — restore user choice between subagent-driven and inline execution after plan writing. Subagent-driven is recommended but no longer mandatory.

## v5.0.4 (2026-03-16)

### Review Loop Refinements

Dramatically reduces token usage and speeds up spec and plan reviews by eliminating unnecessary review passes and tightening reviewer focus.

- **Single whole-plan review** — plan reviewer now reviews the complete plan in one pass instead of chunk-by-chunk. Removed all chunk-related concepts (`## Chunk N:` headings, 1000-line chunk limits, per-chunk dispatch).
- **Raised the bar for blocking issues** — both spec and plan reviewer prompts now include a "Calibration" section: only flag issues that would cause real problems during implementation. Minor wording, stylistic preferences, and formatting quibbles should not block approval.
- **Reduced max review iterations** — from 5 to 3 for both spec and plan review loops. If the reviewer is calibrated correctly, 3 rounds is plenty.
- **Streamlined reviewer checklists** — spec reviewer trimmed from 7 categories to 5; plan reviewer from 7 to 4. Removed formatting-focused checks (task syntax, chunk size) in favor of substance (buildability, spec alignment).

### OpenCode

- **One-line plugin install** — OpenCode plugin now auto-registers the skills directory via a `config` hook. No symlinks or `skills.paths` config needed. Install is just adding one line to `opencode.json`. (PR #753)
- **Added `package.json`** so OpenCode can install omnipowers as an npm package from git.

### Bug Fixes

- **Verify server actually stopped** — `stop-server.sh` now confirms the process is dead before reporting success. SIGTERM + 2s wait + SIGKILL fallback. Reports failure if the process survives. (PR #751)
- **Generic agent language** — brainstorm companion waiting page now says "the agent" instead of "Claude".

## v5.0.3 (2026-03-15)

### Cursor Support

- **Cursor hooks** — added `hooks/hooks-cursor.json` with Cursor's camelCase format (`sessionStart`, `version: 1`) and updated `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` to reference it. Fixed platform detection in `session-start` to check `CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT` first (Cursor may also set `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`). (Based on PR #709)

### Bug Fixes

- **Stop firing SessionStart hook on `--resume`** — the startup hook was re-injecting context on resumed sessions, which already have the context in their conversation history. The hook now fires only on `startup`, `clear`, and `compact`.
- **Bash 5.3+ hook hang** — replaced heredoc (`cat <<EOF`) with `printf` in `hooks/session-start`. Fixes indefinite hang on macOS with Homebrew bash 5.3+ caused by a bash regression with large variable expansion in heredocs. (#572, #571)
- **POSIX-safe hook script** — replaced `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}` with `$0` in `hooks/session-start`. Fixes "Bad substitution" error on Ubuntu/Debian where `/bin/sh` is dash. (#553)
- **Portable shebangs** — replaced `#!/bin/bash` with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` in all shell scripts. Fixes execution on NixOS, FreeBSD, and macOS with Homebrew bash where `/bin/bash` is outdated or missing. (#700)
- **Brainstorm server on Windows** — auto-detect Windows/Git Bash (`OSTYPE=msys*`, `MSYSTEM`) and switch to foreground mode, fixing silent server failure caused by `nohup`/`disown` process reaping. (#737)
- **Codex docs fix** — replaced deprecated `collab` flag with `multi_agent` in Codex documentation. (PR #749)

## v5.0.2 (2026-03-11)

### Zero-Dependency Brainstorm Server

**Removed all vendored node_modules — server.js is now fully self-contained**

- Replaced Express/Chokidar/WebSocket dependencies with zero-dependency Node.js server using built-in `http`, `fs`, and `crypto` modules
- Removed ~1,200 lines of vendored `node_modules/`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json`
- Custom WebSocket protocol implementation (RFC 6455 framing, ping/pong, proper close handshake)
- Native `fs.watch()` file watching replaces Chokidar
- Full test suite: HTTP serving, WebSocket protocol, file watching, and integration tests

### Brainstorm Server Reliability

- **Auto-exit after 30 minutes idle** — server shuts down when no clients are connected, preventing orphaned processes
- **Owner process tracking** — server monitors the parent harness PID and exits when the owning session dies
- **Liveness check** — skill verifies server is responsive before reusing an existing instance
- **Encoding fix** — proper `<meta charset="utf-8">` on served HTML pages

### Subagent Context Isolation

- All delegation skills (brainstorming, dispatching-parallel-agents, requesting-code-review, subagent-driven-development, writing-plans) now include context isolation principle
- Subagents receive only the context they need, preventing context window pollution

## v5.0.1 (2026-03-10)

### Agentskills Compliance

**Brainstorm-server moved into skill directory**

- Moved `lib/brainstorm-server/` → `skills/brainstorming/scripts/` per the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification
- All `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/brainstorm-server/` references replaced with relative `scripts/` paths
- Skills are now fully portable across platforms — no platform-specific env vars needed to locate scripts
- `lib/` directory removed (was the last remaining content)

### New Features

**Gemini CLI extension**

- Native Gemini CLI extension support via `gemini-extension.json` and `GEMINI.md` at repo root
- `GEMINI.md` @imports `using-omnipowers` skill and tool mapping table at session start
- Gemini CLI tool mapping reference (`skills/using-omnipowers/references/gemini-tools.md`) — translates Claude Code tool names (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.) to Gemini CLI equivalents (read_file, write_file, replace, etc.)
- Documents Gemini CLI limitations: no subagent support, skills fall back to `executing-plans`
- Extension root at repo root for cross-platform compatibility (avoids Windows symlink issues)
- Install instructions added to README

### Improvements

**Multi-platform brainstorm server launch**

- Per-platform launch instructions in visual-companion.md: Claude Code (default mode), Codex (auto-foreground via `CODEX_CI`), Gemini CLI (`--foreground` with `is_background`), and fallback for other environments
- Server now writes startup JSON to `$SCREEN_DIR/.server-info` so agents can find the URL and port even when stdout is hidden by background execution

**Brainstorm server dependencies bundled**

- `node_modules` vendored into the repo so the brainstorm server works immediately on fresh plugin installs without requiring `npm` at runtime
- Removed `fsevents` from bundled deps (macOS-only native binary; chokidar falls back gracefully without it)
- Fallback auto-install via `npm install` if `node_modules` is missing

**OpenCode tool mapping fix**

- `TodoWrite` → `todowrite` (was incorrectly mapped to `update_plan`); verified against OpenCode source

### Bug Fixes

**Windows/Linux: single quotes break SessionStart hook** (#577, #529, #644, PR #585)

- Single quotes around `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in hooks.json fail on Windows (cmd.exe doesn't recognize single quotes as path delimiters) and on Linux (single quotes prevent variable expansion)
- Fix: replaced single quotes with escaped double quotes — works across macOS bash, Windows cmd.exe, Windows Git Bash, and Linux, with and without spaces in paths
- Verified on Windows 11 (NT 10.0.26200.0) with Claude Code 2.1.72 and Git for Windows

**Brainstorming spec review loop skipped** (#677)

- The spec review loop (dispatch spec-document-reviewer subagent, iterate until approved) existed in the prose "After the Design" section but was missing from the checklist and process flow diagram
- Since agents follow the diagram and checklist more reliably than prose, the spec review step was being skipped entirely
- Added step 7 (spec review loop) to the checklist and corresponding nodes to the dot graph
- Tested with `claude --plugin-dir` and `claude-session-driver`: worker now correctly dispatches the reviewer

**Cursor install command** (PR #676)

- Fixed Cursor install command in README: `/plugin-add` → `/add-plugin` (confirmed via Cursor 2.5 release announcement)

**User review gate in brainstorming** (#565)

- Added explicit user review step between spec completion and writing-plans handoff
- User must approve the spec before implementation planning begins
- Checklist, process flow, and prose updated with the new gate

**Session-start hook emits context only once per platform**

- Hook now detects whether it's running in Claude Code or another platform
- Emits `hookSpecificOutput` for Claude Code, `additional_context` for others — prevents double context injection

**Linting fix in token analysis script**

- `except:` → `except Exception:` in `tests/claude-code/analyze-token-usage.py`

### Maintenance

**Removed dead code**

- Deleted `lib/skills-core.js` and its test (`tests/opencode/test-skills-core.js`) — unused since February 2026
- Removed skills-core existence check from `tests/opencode/test-plugin-loading.sh`

### Community

- @karuturi — Claude Code official marketplace install instructions (PR #610)
- @mvanhorn — session-start hook dual-emit fix, OpenCode tool mapping fix
- @daniel-graham — linting fix for bare except
- PR #585 author — Windows/Linux hooks quoting fix

## v5.0.0 (2026-03-09)

### Breaking Changes

**Specs and plans directory restructured**

- Specs (brainstorming output) now save to `docs/omnipowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Plans (writing-plans output) now save to `docs/omnipowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- User preferences for spec/plan locations override these defaults
- All internal skill references, test files, and example paths updated to match
- Migration: move existing files from `docs/plans/` to new locations if desired

**Subagent-driven development mandatory on capable harnesses**

Writing-plans no longer offers a choice between subagent-driven and executing-plans. On harnesses with subagent support (Claude Code, Codex), subagent-driven-development is required. Executing-plans is reserved for harnesses without subagent capability, and now tells the user that Omnipowers works better on a subagent-capable platform.

**Executing-plans no longer batches**

Removed the "execute 3 tasks then stop for review" pattern. Plans now execute continuously, stopping only for blockers.

**Slash commands deprecated**

`/brainstorm`, `/write-plan`, and `/execute-plan` now show deprecation notices pointing users to the corresponding skills. Commands will be removed in the next major release.

### New Features

**Visual brainstorming companion**

Optional browser-based companion for brainstorming sessions. When a topic would benefit from visuals, the brainstorming skill offers to show mockups, diagrams, comparisons, and other content in a browser window alongside terminal conversation.

- `lib/brainstorm-server/` — WebSocket server with browser helper library, session management scripts, and dark/light themed frame template ("Omnipowers Brainstorming" with GitHub link)
- `skills/brainstorming/visual-companion.md` — Progressive disclosure guide for server workflow, screen authoring, and feedback collection
- Brainstorming skill adds a visual companion decision point to its process flow: after exploring project context, the skill evaluates whether upcoming questions involve visual content and offers the companion in its own message
- Per-question decision: even after accepting, each question is evaluated for whether browser or terminal is more appropriate
- Integration tests in `tests/brainstorm-server/`

**Document review system**

Automated review loops for spec and plan documents using subagent dispatch:

- `skills/brainstorming/spec-document-reviewer-prompt.md` — Reviewer checks completeness, consistency, architecture, and YAGNI
- `skills/writing-plans/plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md` — Reviewer checks spec alignment, task decomposition, file structure, and file size
- Brainstorming dispatches spec reviewer after writing the design doc
- Writing-plans includes chunk-based plan review loop after each section
- Review loops repeat until approved or escalate after 5 iterations
- End-to-end tests in `tests/claude-code/test-document-review-system.sh`
- Design spec and implementation plan in `docs/omnipowers/`

**Architecture guidance across the skill pipeline**

Design-for-isolation and file-size-awareness guidance added to brainstorming, writing-plans, and subagent-driven-development:

- **Brainstorming** — New sections: "Design for isolation and clarity" (clear boundaries, well-defined interfaces, independently testable units) and "Working in existing codebases" (follow existing patterns, targeted improvements only)
- **Writing-plans** — New "File Structure" section: map out files and responsibilities before defining tasks. New "Scope Check" backstop: catch multi-subsystem specs that should have been decomposed during brainstorming
- **SDD implementer** — New "Code Organization" section (follow plan's file structure, report concerns about growing files) and "When You're in Over Your Head" escalation guidance
- **SDD code quality reviewer** — Now checks architecture, unit decomposition, plan conformance, and file growth
- **Spec/plan reviewers** — Architecture and file size added to review criteria
- **Scope assessment** — Brainstorming now assesses whether a project is too large for a single spec. Multi-subsystem requests are flagged early and decomposed into sub-projects, each with its own spec → plan → implementation cycle

**Subagent-driven development improvements**

- **Model selection** — Guidance for choosing model capability by task type: cheap models for mechanical implementation, standard for integration, capable for architecture and review
- **Implementer status protocol** — Subagents now report DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, BLOCKED, or NEEDS_CONTEXT. Controller handles each status appropriately: re-dispatching with more context, upgrading model capability, breaking tasks apart, or escalating to human

### Improvements

**Instruction priority hierarchy**

Added explicit priority ordering to using-omnipowers:

1. User's explicit instructions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, direct requests) — highest priority
2. Omnipowers skills — override default system behavior
3. Default system prompt — lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD," the user's instructions win.

**SUBAGENT-STOP gate**

Added `<SUBAGENT-STOP>` block to using-omnipowers. Subagents dispatched for specific tasks now skip the skill instead of activating the 1% rule and invoking full skill workflows.

**Multi-platform improvements**

- Codex tool mapping moved to progressive disclosure reference file (`references/codex-tools.md`)
- Platform Adaptation pointer added so non-Claude-Code platforms can find tool equivalents
- Plan headers now address "agentic workers" instead of "Claude" specifically
- Collab feature requirement documented in `docs/README.codex.md`

**Writing-plans template updates**

- Plan steps now use checkbox syntax (`- [ ] **Step N:**`) for progress tracking
- Plan header references both subagent-driven-development and executing-plans with platform-aware routing
